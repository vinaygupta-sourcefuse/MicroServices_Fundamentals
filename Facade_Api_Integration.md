### **🚀 Facade Pattern for API Integration**  

The **Facade Pattern** is a **structural design pattern** that provides a **simplified interface** to a complex system. In API integration, it acts as an **abstraction layer** between clients and multiple microservices or external APIs.

---

## **🔹 Why Use a Facade for API Integration?**
✔ **Simplifies API calls** → Clients interact with a **single endpoint** instead of multiple microservices.  
✔ **Encapsulates complexity** → Hides authentication, error handling, and transformations.  
✔ **Enhances maintainability** → Reduces tight coupling between client and microservices.  
✔ **Improves performance** → Aggregates data from multiple APIs into a single response.

## **🔹 How to Implement a Facade in LoopBack 4**
### **Scenario: Aggregating Book & Author APIs**
We have:
- **Book Service** (`/books`) → Provides book details.  
- **Author Service** (`/authors`) → Provides author details.  
- We create a **Facade API** (`/library`) that combines both.  

---

### **1️⃣ Create the Facade Service in LoopBack 4**
```sh
lb4 app library-facade
```

### **2️⃣ Define a Facade Controller (`src/controllers/library.controller.ts`)**
```ts
import {get} from '@loopback/rest';
import fetch from 'node-fetch';

export class LibraryController {
  private bookServiceUrl = 'http://localhost:3001/books';
  private authorServiceUrl = 'http://localhost:3002/authors';

  @get('/library')
  async getLibraryData() {
    // Fetch books and authors in parallel
    const [booksRes, authorsRes] = await Promise.all([
      fetch(this.bookServiceUrl).then(res => res.json()),
      fetch(this.authorServiceUrl).then(res => res.json()),
    ]);

    // Map authors to books
    const authorsMap = new Map(authorsRes.map(author => [author.id, author]));
    const booksWithAuthors = booksRes.map(book => ({
      ...book,
      author: authorsMap.get(book.authorId),
    }));

    return {books: booksWithAuthors};
  }
}
```

---

### **3️⃣ Benefits of This Facade**
✅ **Single API Call** – Instead of multiple requests, clients call `/library`.  
✅ **Data Aggregation** – Combines book and author data into a unified response.  
✅ **Decoupling** – The client doesn’t need to know about **multiple services**.

## **🛠 Additional Enhancements**
- **Add Caching** (e.g., Redis) to improve performance.  
- **Use GraphQL** instead of REST for flexible queries.  
- **Secure with API Gateway** to handle authentication & rate limiting.
